# style-transfer

## What it does
A simple web app that takes 2 images - content image and style image - and generates a new stylised image by transferring the style from the style image to the content image.

## How we built it
Tensorflow was used to perform the neural style transfer logic and Streamlit was used to create the frontend for the web app.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced some difficulties in converting images to tensors. There were also some challenges with deploying the web app.
